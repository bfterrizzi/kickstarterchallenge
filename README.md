brief analysis of kickstarter campaign data

These analyses were completed as part of an admissions challenge for a data science bootcamp. 
The original data (supplied by the program) is contained in "ks-data.sql". 
All other files are authored by myself.  
The contents of ks-data are wrangled, organized, and exported for analysis in the file "kickstarter_wrangling_script.sql". 
The analyses and report are included in "kickstarter_analysis.Rmd", an R Markdown file. 
There are two versions of the final report "kickstarter_report...pdf" with and without the code corresponding to the figures and analyses.
